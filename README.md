## Red Servo

### Description

This is the first assignment for engineering 3. We were tasked with turning the color of the imbedded led, in our metro express servo, from blue to red. I chose to take it one step further and make the led repeat a rainbow pattern. 

### Process

We were given the basic code and a website that allowed us to determine the RGB vaules of colors (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp). Changing the color to red was as simple as changing two numbers in the code from (0, 0, 255) to (255, 0, 0). After that I used time.sleep(#) to tell the metro when to pause and then just copied and pasted a bunch of color vaules so that the end result was my led flashing a rainbow pattern
